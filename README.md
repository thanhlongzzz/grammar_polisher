## Code style
- Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Import from dart package first, then flutter package, then project package, then current package
- Importing from the same package should be in one line and use relative path
    - ex: `import '../../models/user_model.dart'`

## Usage

### Install dependencies
- Move to root dir `cd {root}`
- Install necessary packages `flutter pub get`

### Generate files
- Generate necessary files: `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
- Click `Build` -> `Generate Flutter Assets` to generate assets path
- Note: If you create a new assets folder, right-click on the folder and click `Flutter: Configuring Paths` to add assets path into `pubspec.yaml`

### Run
- We have 2 flavors: `development` and `production`
- Get the environment file from [alexcao194](https://github.com/alexcao194) or create your own env file and put it in `.env/` folder, that named `development.json`
- Run `flutter run --flavor development --dart-define-from-file=.env/development.json` to run the app in development mode

### Sign with your own keystore
- Create a keystore file `keystore.jks`, it should be placed in `android/app` folder
- Create a file `key.properties` in `android` folder with the following content:

```
storePassword=<password>
keyPassword=<password>
keyAlias=<alias>
storeFile=<relative path to keystore file> (from android/app)
```

### Build
This project uses Fastlane to build and release the app. To build the app, you can run the following commands:
- Android:
  - `cd android`
  - `fastlane release --env production`
- IOS:
  - `cd ios`
  - `fastlane release --env production`

And That's it! You are ready to go! 🚀
